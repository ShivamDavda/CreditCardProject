# Credit Card Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes credit card customer data to understand spending behavior, payment patterns, and credit utilization. The dataset contains transaction details and customer information from a credit card company.

## Dataset
- Original data file: `CC_GENERAL.csv`
- Cleaned data file: `Clean_credit_carddata.csv`

The dataset includes features such as balance, purchase amounts, cash advances, payment history, credit limits, and tenure.

## Objective
- Explore data distributions and relationships among key variables.
- Create new features like spending level, payment flags, and credit utilization.
- Visualize insights with histograms, scatter plots, and correlation heatmaps.

## Key Features Created
- `Purchase_level`: Categorizes customers as 'low', 'medium', or 'high' spenders.
- `Payment_flag`: Indicates whether the customer pays the full payment.
- `Utilized_limit`: Ratio of balance to credit limit.
- `Cashadvance_label`: Whether the customer has taken a cash advance.
- `Active_purchase`: Whether the customer has made any purchases.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization

## How to Use
1. Download the repository.
2. Open the Jupyter notebook or Python script.
3. Ensure `CC_GENERAL.csv` is in the `data/` folder or adjust the path accordingly.
4. Run the notebook/script to see the analysis and visualizations.

## Output
- Cleaned dataset saved as `Clean_credit_carddata.csv`.
- Various charts and plots displayed in the notebook.
